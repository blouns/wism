Goals: 
* Bug Fixes: 1, 5, 7, 9, 11

Bugs:
  1 Select next army on Defense or Quit
  2 Hero with allies notification goes too fast / is overritten by production reports
  3 Hero strength mysteriously dropped (was 9, then picked up Spear of Ankh and went to 8 w/ 2 Bonus)
  4 Click targets are not super accurate
  5 No beep when no more 'next' army
  6 Saved game at slot 4, then it moved to 3, then overwrote and got both 3 and 4
  7 Hero displays above the Navy
  8 Screen flicker about 1/sec
  9 Production renewal panel is too narrow and Yes/No buttons stick
  11 Next army selection is selecting groups with zero moves
  12 Single-click selection is a bit slow and doesn't differntiate from select-all
  13 Navy attacks in wrong order (not last)
  14 Navy can move into a city during attack; moving to another part of city results in NullReferenceException (below)
	>> Can't move from source because the navy is on land (city) and it's not traversable
	>> Dijkstra Line 39: graph[armiesToMove[0].X, armiesToMove[0].Y].Distance = 0.0f; // graph[x,y] =  null
  15 Navy under production seemingly dissappeared; left the city with no production
  16 8th Save location is not clickable
  17 Duplicate GameObject created; broken stack and cannot be merged (but can be moved together); See "Dupe GO Repro" saved game

 Future:
  * Clan and army balance and attribute details (e.g. terrain bonuses)
  * Test case generator from UI
  * All-city production panel
  * Hero finder
  * Production in alternate location
  * Enhanced mini-map icons
  * AI
  * Show unsearched locations
