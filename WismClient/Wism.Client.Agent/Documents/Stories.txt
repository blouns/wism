[What's Next?]
Goal for the next phase is to implement cities and the production system. This will see new
armies created, next-army select, city defense and army mustering, and city ownership.

TODO List:
* Refactor state-machine in ASCII UI

[Next Command]
Next command needs a list of armies that are new or not marked "Defend". This can be implemented
using the Player's armies list checking at the start of each turn for any !Defend armies. This
will be added to a Next-list which will allow the UI to advance quickly through each unit.

[Production Queue]
Production only occurs at the start of a turn. For any new unit created, it must be added to a 
new-units list. This will allow the UI to prompt to notify the human of new units and allow them
to renew production or cancel.

[Other]
Consider a simple AI that attacks if it has the tactical advantage (strength) and runs if it 
is weaker. Also, consider adding ASCII shortcuts for common tasks (perhaps a recorder for the 
moves that can be saved?).
